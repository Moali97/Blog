# Django Blog

This is a blog made with Django, HTML and CSS. It has create, read, update and delete features (CRUD) and has an authenication system which allows users to register and login to make blogs and let other users know which user created a particular blog.

Firstly to make a blog post,you will need to sign by pressing the sign-up button and follow the instructions, then you can create and delete blog posts. This blog was made so I can share my jpurmey learning web development.
